# feminims

Here I use topic modeling in R to analyse texts from feminists. The texts come from different sources such as blogs, magazines, books, interviews, essays, and are written in German, Portuguese and English.
The aim of the study is to identify similarities and dissimilarities in the discourses of feminists in the German, Brazilian, North American (USA) and British cultures.
